function can be exported from one js file to another using module.exports and require methods.

Fat arrow function  should be one line to export i.e., exports.sum = (a,b)=> a+b; only works
const sum = (a,b)=> a+b; and exports.sum doesn't work

 exports is a private to each module

 Object destructuring means importing only the required methods like importing required function only in JAVA.


Nodemon= built in package of NPM (node package manager) to reflect the changes done in server without restarting the server

scripts part of package.json is used to run application. Example: if i want to run node app.js then this "node app.js" can be written in script part of package.json like
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "dev": "nodemon app.js"
  }

  now we can do "npm run dev"
